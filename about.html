        <p>
          My name is Dina Liubarets, and I am a multi-professional businesswoman
          as well as an entrepreneur.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a lawyer, as well as a coder. I was in Ukraine while studying law
          and finished Law school over there. Since childhood, I had a strong
          attraction towards law and computers, but when I grew up, things never
          turned out to be the way I wanted them to be. It seemed as if I had to
          choose between Law and Computer. So initially, I decided to take law
          as a Computer profession that can be pursued at any age. After getting
          over with my Law School in Ukraine, I practiced law for 3 years. And
          of course, I had to, what would be the point of studying law if you
          were not to practice it. Anyway, I have to admit that my experience
          while practicing was terrific. I saw a series of mixed events, some of
          the cases I won and some I lost, but they gave me a lot of experience
          and helped to polish and cook for the working world. A significant
          milestone in my life was in 2013, when I decided to move to Canada. It
          had already been six years since I was managing and growing my family
          business. I had loads of responsibility on my shoulders, but my
          passion for computers sparked again. And this time it was something a
          lot more specific, I developed an interest in coding websites. I
          learned to code, and suddenly this was a passion that I could not get
          rid of.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020 I decided to join a 24-week coding boot camp at Carleton
          University. That experience was so overwhelming for me. I loved to sit
          in front of a computer and code and solve all those problems. My life
          had an empty spot for technology, and coding filled that, and I
          suddenly felt complete. Tech is now an integral part of my life, and I
          love to learn new things and experiment. Moreover, it is also very
          satisfying and comfortable when I'm learning or building new stuff or
          programs. It has been some years since I decided that the world should
          know about me and the achievements I've made in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I made an Instagram blog where I share posts and videos regarding
          my work and life and allow other people to get motivated so they can
          do something similar. I also have a passion for exploring the world.
          Hence, my love for traveling and the need to post on social media get
          along very well. I appreciate and appreciate the photos, videos,
          adventures, and fun that come with my travel. If said honestly, I
          would love to keep this up for the rest of my life. We can not deny
          the fact that fashion is one of the elementary parts of social media.
          What a productive coincidence that fashion is also an essential part
          of my life, and this sense of fashion allows me to post quality
          pictures and videos and set new trends for my audience to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all that I did in my life and the victories I've won, I can
          confidently and proudly say that I have good leadership and management
          skills. I can quickly analyze situations, deduce possible outcomes and
          consequences of the decision, and take suitable and appropriate
          actions. All the people who worked with me have learned a lot from me,
          and the same goes for me. I am very responsible in every field of
          life. Even though all this responsibility is sometimes too much to
          handle, I am very open about myself. This behavior also allows me to
          have an interactive and productive relationship with my coworkers and
          family members. Another trait that I like is that I can manage time
          efficiently. I have to admit that the responsibility I took from such
          a young age taught me many things, one of which was the value of time.
          I am ready to welcome new things in my life, but I also do not forget
          to maintain the old ones' importance. Along with fashion, photography,
          law, and coding, I also know how to read stars. I have knowledge of
          Astro psychology and filming. I know criminal law, and I can build
          websites on both the front and back ends.
