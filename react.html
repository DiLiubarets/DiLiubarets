      <div class="section-center">
        <p>
          <a href="https://vuejs.org"><strong>Vue</strong></a> and
          <a href="https://reactjs.org"><strong>React</strong></a> are
          undoubtedly among the most popular JavaScript frameworks. Even though
          they have different philosophies, they are similar in some aspects.
          Let's dive into these two frameworks and understand how they stack up
          against each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do anything but mention, "which framework is better for front
          end development." You will have the otherwise pacifist developer
          community up in arms immediately! This question, "which framework is a
          better choice?" is a hot topic of debate and results in a lot of
          altercation between the developer communities. Eventually, as far as
          the developer is concerned, it's a personal preference. However, it
          always helps if you can put some context behind the choice.
        </p>
        <strong>Origins</strong>
        <p>
          React was developed by an internal team at Facebook, whereas Vue was
          created out of a solo quest. While React had its genesis at Facebook,
          it was primarily designed to find a better way to code and make the
          front end more responsive, Vue was
          <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/team.html"> Evan You's </a>
          brainchild ( ex-Googler ). Vue has a massive following and garners
          support from a diverse set of supporters spread across the world.
          React considers itself more of a library than a framework, its
          minimalistic and focused on UI building. Both hel
        </p>
        <strong>Where do they differ?</strong>
        <p>
          With React, you do not have access to a standard router or features
          like an application-wide state management solution. You would need to
          reach out to the React community for community-managed packages for
          such solutions. On the other hand, Vue comes with a router and state
          management solution, which is maintained by the Vue core team.
        </p>

        <p>
          In React, there is no specific HTML and Java Script separation. There
          is a section for Java Script function and a feature known as JSX,
          which tells React to render the particular section of your HTML
          content. In Vue, there is a stricter separation of HTML and
          JavaScript, and it allows us to manipulate HTML with a specific
          syntax, which is exclusively understood by Vue when the code s parsed.
        </p>

        <p>
          As far as the learning curve is concerned, React may require more
          effort at the beginning for a developer to get used to the merged
          version of HTML and JavaScript and the introduction of JSX. Whereas it
          commonly believed that Vue is simpler to learn, you can get started by
          just adding an import to an HTML file and start seeing results. It
          also helps that it separates the HTML and JavaScript. So it’s more
          comfortable to relate.
        </p>

        <p>
          In terms of performance, React, and Vue have similar startup
          performance, that's when the framework/library of Vue and React gets
          downloaded to the end-user along with your code. The bundle sizes
          should be similar to both these frameworks, so the startup performance
          should be the same. As far as run time performance is concerned, it
          does get influenced by your code and the behind-the-scenes working of
          the framework. You may get different performance scores depending on
          the use case. So there is no definite answer here.
        </p>
        <strong>Popularity</strong>
        <p>
          If you go by Google trends, Vue is slightly more popular than React.
          In the US, however, React is more popular. Another measure can be npm
          downloads.
          <a href="https://www.npmtrends.com/react-vs-vue">
            React is downloaded much more than Vue, almost four times more.
          </a>
          Compare Reacts 6 million downloads a week to Vue's 1.5 million. In
          terms of employability, React overshadows Vue by a considerable
          margin. There are 42% more projects in React as compared to Vue. The
          number of jobs also narrates a similar story. For example, there are
          twelve times more jobs for React than for Vue in indeed.com and five
          times more in LinkedIn.
        </p>
        <strong>Future</strong>
        <p>
          Both React and Vue are under active development, and they have been
          around for some time, with React just being slightly longer than Vue.
          React does get the impetus from being part of Facebook, and Facebook
          adds the necessary stability to React's future. But one cannot
          discount the growing popularity of Vue. It is observed that with time
          more gifted developers are becoming part of the Core team at Vue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The changes in both frameworks are evolving step by step. New features
          are added continuously, and the old ones are being truncated or
          deprecated. As it happens, there is no fixed schedule for React
          releases. The most talked-about major feature from React is called

            >Hooks</a
          >. (Hooks was released with React 16.8 in February 2019, which is
          almost a couple of years back). Hooks help in improving code reuse and
          results in better code decomposition and defaults. Vue is at Vue 3
          with the release planned in Q3 of 2020. Evan You promised Vue 3 to be
          faster, smaller, and more maintainable. For further deep dive, have a

        <strong>Who uses these Frameworks? </strong>
        <p>
          React is a JavaScript library that was open-sourced by Facebook in
          2013, and it's great for building modern applications. Many
          multi-billion dollar companies rely on React, apart from Facebook,
          React is used by Airbnb, Microsoft, Slack, Dropbox, Whatsapp,
          Instagram, Yahoo, Netflix, New York Times, and Codeacademy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vue had its origins in China, but today it’s a globally adopted
          framework. Big-name companies who use Vue are Alibaba, Adobe, Reuters,
          Xiaomi, Codeship, Behance, BuzzFeed, Nintendo, Grammarly, and
          Trustpilot.
        </p>
        <strong>Conclusion</strong>
        <p>
          The decision on a framework of choice is never that straight forward.
          You have to consider factors like speed, community, learning curve,
          and maturity, to name a few. Both React and Vue score well in these
          areas. That's what makes a choice difficult.
        </p>

        <p>
          React as a framework has matured over time. It is backed by Facebook,
          which tells it is not going to go away any time soon. The market has
          widely accepted it, and the number of jobs reflects real demand.
          People are developing more in React than in any other framework. React
          should be your choice for designing scalable products; the framework
          is modular and efficient.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, Vue is continuously growing, with more and more
          contributors teaming up across the world, it is natural to expect Vue
          to keep on improving. It is relatively new but has a lot of enthusiasm
          from the street. Expect Vue to be competitive as it brings in
          flexibility and simplicity.
