        <h2>Javascript Algorithms</h2>
        <div class="underline"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="section-center">
        <p>
          Algorithmic challenges are effective because there are multiple ways
          to solve them. This opens up the possibility of making decisions and
          the calculation of those decisions. When solving algorithmic problems,
          you need to look at the definition of the problem from multiple
          perspectives and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the
          different approaches. With enough practice, you may even get a glimpse
          of the universal truth. There is no "perfect" solution.
        </p>
        <strong>Why JavaScript Algorithms are important?</strong>
        <p>
          JavaScript algorithms also play a major role in the software
          implementation and adoption process. Many students and professionals
          have this question as to why these company interviews focus on DSA
          rather than language / framework / tool specific questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you ask someone to decide something, a good person can tell you. "I
          chose X because it's better than A and B in these respects. I could
          have used C, but I felt this was a better choice in our daily lives.
          Always go with someone who can complete the task efficiently and in a
          short amount of time. The same thing happens with these companies. The
          problems they face are much more difficult. Yes, it's much larger.
          Software developers must also make the right decisions when solving
          the problems of these companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowledge of algorithms such as hashtables, trees, trials, graphs, and
          various algorithms can be of great help in solving these problems
          efficiently. Interviewers are interested in seeing how candidates can
          use these tools to solve their problems. Just as an auto mechanic
          needs the right tools to repair a car and make it work properly,
          programmers need the right tools (algorithms and data structures) to
          make the software work properly. Therefore, the interviewer wants to
          find a candidate who can apply the appropriate set of tools to solve a
          given problem. .. If you know the characteristics of one data
          structure, as opposed to another, you can make the right decisions
          when choosing the right data structure to solve the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Engineers working for companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and
          Amazon, unlike other companies, pay a lot more than other companies
          ... but why? In these companies, coding is just an implementation and
          takes about 20-30% of the time allotted to the project. In most cases,
          you will design with the best and best algorithms to save your
          company's resources (servers, computing power, etc.). This is the main
          reason why interviews with these companies focus on algorithms. They
          need people that can plan of the box to style algorithms which
          will save companies thousands of dollars. Youtube, Facebook, Twitter,
          Instagram, Google MapsAll these sites have the most users in the
          world. To handle more users on these sites, we need to do more
          optimizations. As a result, product-based companies are only hiring
          candidates who can optimize their software to meet their needs..
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose you work for a Facebook company. Find the optimal solution to
          the problem (such as sorting the list of users in India) with the time
          complexity of O (nLogn) instead of O (n ^ 2) and assume that the
          actual company problem is n. The life scenario is 100 million (a very
          fair assumption given that Facebook has more than 1 billion users).
          nLogn is 800 million and n ^ 2 is 10 ^ 7 billion. In terms of cost, we
          find that it is more than 10 ^ 7 times more efficient. This can save
          you a lot of server cost and time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you may want to hire smart developers who can make the right
          decisions and save their resources, time and money. Therefore,
          carefully consider all large case scenarios before providing a
          solution that uses hashtables instead of lists to solve a particular
          problem. It can bring income to the company or the company can lose
          huge amounts of money.

        <strong>A * Search algorithm</strong>
        <p>
          A graph search algorithm that finds the path from a particular initial
          node to a particular goal node. It employs a heuristic estimate that
          ranks each node by an estimate of the simplest route through each
          node. Access the nodes during this heuristic estimation order.
          Therefore, the A * algorithm is an example of a best-first search.

        <pre><code>let linearSearch = (list,value)=> { 
            for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
                 if (list[i] === value) { 
                     return i; 
                    } 
                } return -1; 
            } 
            var list = [12, 45, 48, 5, 451, 2, 34, 43, 54, 66 ] 
            var value = 2; linearSearch(list, value) 
            // result should 5</code></pre>

        <p>
          A technique for finding specific values ​​in a linear array by
          excluding half of the data at each step.
        </p>
        <strong>Branch and bound method</strong>
        <p>
          A common algorithmic technique for finding optimal solutions for
          various optimization problems, especially in discrete optimization and
          combinatorial optimization. Buchberger's Algorithm In computational
          algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, Buchberger's algorithm may
          be a method of remodeling a specific set of generators of a polynomial
          ideal into a Gröbner basis with reference to a monomial order. This
          can be seen as a generalization of the Euclidean algorithm for
          univariate gcd computation and Gaussian elimination for linear
          systems.
        </p>
        <strong>Data compression</strong>
        <p>
          Data compression or source coding is that the process of encoding
          information using fewer bits (or other communication units) than an
          unencoded representation uses employing a particular encoding scheme
        </p>
        <strong>Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</strong>
        <p>
          An encryption protocol that allows two parties without prior knowledge
          of each other to jointly establish a shared private key over an
          insecure communication channel. This key can be used to encrypt
          subsequent communications using symmetric key cryptography.
        </p>
        <strong>Dijkstra's algorithm</strong>
        <p>
          An algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem of
          directed graphs with non-negative edge weights.
        </p>
        <strong>Dynamic programming</strong>
        <p>
          Dynamic programming is a method for reducing the execution time of
          algorithms that demonstrate overlapping sub-problems and optimal
          substructure characteristics, as described below.
        </p>
        <strong>Euclidean algorithm</strong>
        <p>
          An algorithm that determines the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two
          integers. It is one of the oldest known algorithms since it first
          appeared in Euclid's Elements around 300 BC. This algorithm does not
          need to factor two integers.
        </p>
        <strong>Expected Value Maximization Algorithm (EM Training)</strong>
        <p>
          In statistical calculations, the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
          algorithm is an algorithm for locating the utmost likelihood estimates
          of the parameters of a probabilistic model whose model depends on
          unobserved latent variables. The EM alternates between performing an
          expected step of calculating the expected value of a latent variable
          and a maximizing step of calculating the maximum likelihood estimate
          for a given parameter and setting the latent variable to the expected
          value.
        </p>
        <strong>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</strong>
        <p>
          An efficient algorithm for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform
          (DFT) and vice versa. FFTs are very important for a variety of
          applications, from digital signal processing to solving partial
          differential equations to algorithms that quickly multiply large
          integers.
        </p>
        <strong>The steepest descent method</strong>
        <p>
          The steepest descent method is an optimization algorithm that
          approaches the minimum value of a function by performing steps
          proportional to the negative value of the gradient (or approximate
          gradient) of the function at the current point. Instead, taking steps
          proportional to the gradient approaches the maximum value of the
          function. This procedure is known as gradient climbing.
        </p>
        <strong>Hash</strong>
        <p>
          A function for summarizing or probabilistically identifying data. This
          usually means applying a formula to the data to produce a string that
          is probably more or less unique to that data. The string is much
          shorter than the original data, but can be used to uniquely identify
          it.
        </p>
        <strong>Heap (heapsort)</strong>
        <p>
          In computer science, the heap is a special tree-based data structure.
          The heap is a popular data structure in many applications. Heapsort,
          selection algorithm (finds any kth element of minimum, maximum, or
          both, median, or sublinear time), graph algorithm.
        </p>
        <strong>Maximum flow</strong>
        <p>
          The maximum flow problem is finding a legitimate flow through the most
          important flow network. it's sometimes defined as finding the worth of
          such a flow. the utmost flow problem are often seen as a special case
          of more complex network flow problems. Maximum flow is related to
          cutting the network by the maximum flow min-cut theorem. The
          Ford-Fulkerson algorithm calculates the utmost flow during a flow
          network.
        </p>
        <strong>Merge sort</strong>
        <p>
          A sorting algorithm for sorting lists (or other data structures that
          can only be accessed in order, such as file streams) in a specified
          order.
