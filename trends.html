      <div class="section-center">
        <p>
          Web development is emerging dynamically as new tech and technologies
          are changing at a greater extent. Following the recent trend in web
          development is crucial than ever. Technologies started way back in
          days are still standing strong, whereas the new development
          technologies are booming with the application market’s rise.
        </p>
        <p>
          What are the web development trends we need to consider? In this
          highly competitive digital market, it's noteworthy to mention,
          developers and business entities need to adopt the technology amid
          user interest and usability. We have researched a few industries and
          sort out pioneer web development trends in the present and beyond.
        </p>
        <strong>JavaScript keeps getting better</strong>
        <p>
          The last year's JavaScript trend report shows developers are
          considering it as the rapidly growing programming language for web
          development. JavaScript did not get here easily; in 2009, when it
          started, jQuery was about to engulf the functionality of JavaScript.
          To this day, it has stretched its wings to become the smartest choice
          of a developer. The endless dedication of JavaScript towards framework
          development has powered the modern trend of web apps. JavaScript is
          not going anywhere soon. Here, we are looking after the trend marks
          set by JavaScript collected from various sources.

        <strong>React’s domination</strong>
        <p>
          Since Facebook launched React JS, it has been dominating the web
          development technology trend. It is an open-source JavaScript
          framework enriched with developing web apps. The functionality of
          JavaScript is minimal; a simple code is powerful enough to generate
          web apps efficiently. React JS has gained a large community quickly,
          there won't be an issue if one gets stuck while programming; the
          solution is always there. React JS makes project handling more
          manageable; it does not ask developers to rework frequently. The
          robust programming language ensures faster rendering with any of the
          browsers.
        </p>
        <strong>Benefits of React JS:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>* Code remains stable;</li>
          <li>* Content rendering becomes faster;</li>
          <li>* Lightweight to use;</li>
          <li>* Dynamic coding behaviour;</li>
          <li>* SEO friendly;</li>
          <li>* Compatible with any browser environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>React and Angular JS</strong>
        <p>
          When it comes to user interface development, known as front-end
          development, React, and Angular JS are the big names. Last year, we
          witnessed a slight dip in technology implementation; however, the
          global trend of React and Angular JS is expected to rise. It's
          reported 71% of recurring developers are considering a return to JS.
          It is a slight satisfaction in the increase, which is expected to grow
          shortly.

        />
        <p>
          The following graph shows the aggregated job posting by the end of
          2019. The JavaScript frameworks are ruling the web development
          market.  As of the figure, React JS is at the substantial lead,
          attracting 37% of the share, whereas Angular JS shares the list of
          about 25%.
        </p>
        <strong>TypeScript Consensus will surge</strong>
        <p>
          Information Technology never stops evolving. With the increase in
          digitalization, the web development market is on the rise. It's about
          time to learn details on the likely future web technology trends and
          its TypeScript.  TypeScript is a subset of JavaScript; the existing
          application on JavaScript would be valid in TypeScript. It basically
          improves coding behavior with Object-oriented programming and static
          typing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might be wondering, is it time to entail TypeScript in the
          enterprise. The answer would be- Yes! The typeScript was a progressive
          year for 2019. It is expected to sky-rocket shortly due to its coding
          environment and understandability. There has been a case where
          developers report that TypeScript is developer-friendly. It has fewer
          bugs, and code is simple to read. The tool interface in TypeScript
          generates self-documentation; with these features and usability, the
          opportunity of TypeScript is vivid in the coming days. The
          gratification of developers implementing TypeScript in web development
          is definite as of now. It's forth to see what the future brings. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Every now and then, the functionality of TypeScript is usually
          evolving, including grammar. With the welcomed features and syntax,
          developers find it easy to execute impactful code.

          Why Developers Love to Use TypeScript in 2020?</a
        ><br />
        <strong>TypeScript role in web development</strong>
        <p>
          A handful of reasons can be mentioned why TypeScript is the hot trend
          in web development. A few of the roles of TypeScript in development
          are discussed below.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1. Coding dynamics:</strong>
            Simple Object Oriented programming with inheritance supporting
            Public, Private, and Protected access control. Since TypeScript uses
            a type interface, using the User object can be initialized without
            creating an actual user.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. Async programming:</strong>
            TypeScript allows flexibility to developers to make use of union,
            partial, and intersection types, avoiding complex typing
            environments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. Faster run-time:</strong>
            Since TypeScript is a subset of JavaScript, Asynchronous programming
            plays a substantial role while developing a web app. Also, the
            asynchronous nature of TypeScript helps in faster load and run-time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4. Ecosystem:</strong>
            The most significant advantage of TypeScript over other programming
            languages is its ability to inherit a fast featured environment. The
            ecosystem of TypeScript is somewhat similar to JavaScript, making it
            robust for web development.  
          </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>TypeScript versus JavaScript</strong>
        <p>
          Although there is less (7.4%) of posting in openings jobs of
          TypeScript, it's expected to remain solid in the coming days.
          TypeScript is in high demand in the job market. Since TypeScript is
          proprietary of JavaScript, you should not be afraid if you love
          TypeScript. That being said, both of the technology is stable in web
          development. It should not hurt your coding practices; somewhat, in
          the future, it is expected to increase the productivity of your
          company. TypeScript is leaner towards the bug reduction benefits,
          whereas JavaScript focuses on interoperability and functionality.

          </li>
          <li>
            4. TypeScript and JavaScript web apps are more comfortable with
            coding, reading, and debugging.
          </li>
          <li>
            5. The TypeScript functions with REST parameters and support
